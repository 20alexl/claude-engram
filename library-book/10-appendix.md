## MCP Tool Reference

### Essential Tools

#### `claude_engram_status()`

Check Claude Engram health (Ollama connection, model availability, memory stats, queue stats).

#### `session_start(project_path)`

Deep context load: memories, checkpoints, decisions, memory health, auto-cleanup. The SessionStart hook auto-starts a basic session, but this gives the full picture.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `project_path` | `str` | Yes | Project directory path |

#### `session_end(project_path?)`

Optional. Shows session summary. All memories auto-save without it.

#### `pre_edit_check(file_path)`

Unified check before editing: past mistakes, loop risk, scope status, scored memories.

---

### `memory` Tool (20 operations)

All operations require `operation` and `project_path`.

| Operation | Additional Parameters | Description |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------|
| `remember` | `content`, `category?`, `relevance?` | Store a memory |
| `recall` | — | Get all memories for project |
| `forget` | — | Clear all project memories |
| `search` | `file_path?`, `tags?`, `query?`, `limit?` | Find memories by criteria |
| `hybrid_search` | `query`, `file_path?`, `tags?`, `limit?` | Semantic + keyword + scored search (best retrieval) |
| `embed_all` | — | Generate AllMiniLM embeddings for all memories |
| `cleanup` | `dry_run?`, `min_relevance?`, `max_age_days?` | Dedupe + archive + decay (clustering is internal) |
| `add_rule` | `content`, `reason?` | Add permanent rule (never decays) |
| `list_rules` | — | Get all rules for project |
| `modify` | `memory_id`, `content?`, `relevance?`, `category?` | Edit a memory |
| `delete` | `memory_id` | Remove a single memory |
| `batch_delete` | `memory_ids?`, `category?` | Bulk delete (rules/mistakes protected) |
| `promote` | `memory_id`, `reason?` | Promote memory to rule |
| `recent` | `category?`, `limit?` | Recent memories, newest first |
| `archive` | `dry_run?` | Move old memories to cold tier |
| `restore` | `memory_id` | Bring archived memory back to active |
| `archive_search` | `query?`, `tags?`, `limit?` | Search cold tier |

| `list_mistakes` | — | View tracked mistakes with IDs, files, age |
| `acknowledge_mistake` | `memory_id` | Archive a learned mistake (stops pre-edit warnings) |

### `work` Tool

| Operation | Parameters | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `log_mistake` | `description`, `file_path?`, `how_to_avoid?` | Record an error |
| `log_decision` | `decision`, `reason`, `alternatives?` | Record a choice |

### `scope` Tool

| Operation | Parameters | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|

| `status` | — | Get violations and scope state |
| `clear` | — | Reset scope |

> The `loop` tool was removed in v0.8.0. Loop detection is hook-automatic: edits and test results are tracked in per-session hook state by the PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks, which warn on real spirals (repeat edits with failing tests). There is no agent-callable loop op.

### `context` Tool

Checkpoint and handoff are one unified ring buffer. `checkpoint_*` are the primary names; `handoff_*` are deprecated aliases kept for backward compatibility.

| Operation | Parameters | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `checkpoint_save` | `task_description`, `current_step?`, `completed_steps?`, `pending_steps?`, `files_involved?`, `handoff_summary?`, `handoff_context_needed?`, `handoff_warnings?` | Save task state; emits HANDOFF.md when handoff content is present |
| `checkpoint_restore` | `index?`, `task_id?` | Restore a checkpoint: `index=0` latest, `index=N` older from history |
| `checkpoint_list` | — | List unified checkpoint/handoff history newest-first (index, age, kind, summary) |
| `verify_completion` | `task`, `verification_steps`, `evidence?` | Claim + verify done |
| `handoff_create` | `handoff_summary`, `next_steps`, `handoff_context_needed?`, `handoff_warnings?` | [deprecated alias of checkpoint_save] |

| `handoff_list` | `project_path?` | [deprecated alias of checkpoint_list] |

### `convention` Tool

| `check` | `project_path`, `code_or_filename` | Deterministic pattern check against stored conventions (no LLM) |
| `remove` | `project_path`, `rule` | Remove by matching text |

> The `output` tool (`validate_code` / `validate_result`) was removed in v0.8.0. Its inline checks are covered by `audit_batch`'s inline mode (`code` + `language`).

### Standalone Tools

| Tool | Parameters | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `scout_search` | `query`, `directory`, `max_results?` | Semantic codebase search (uses Ollama when available) |
| `file_summarize` | `file_path` | Structural summary (purpose, exports, dependencies, complexity) — pattern-based, no LLM |
| `deps_map` | `file_path`, `project_root?`, `include_reverse?` | Map dependencies |
| `impact_analyze` | `file_path`, `project_root`, `proposed_changes?` | Change impact analysis |
| `audit_batch` | `file_paths`+`min_severity?` (files) · or `code`+`language?` (inline) | Audit files or lint a snippet for AI-slop patterns — pure regex/AST, no LLM |
| `find_similar_issues` | `issue_pattern`, `project_path`, `file_extensions?`, `exclude_paths?` | Search for bug patterns — pure regex/AST, no LLM |

> `scout_analyze` was removed in v0.8.0 (zero recorded use — the agent reads code better than a 12B commentary pass).

### MCP Tool Annotations

All 16 MCP tools carry MCP annotations (`readOnlyHint`, `idempotentHint`, `title`, `openWorldHint`). 8 read-only analysis tools (`claude_engram_status`, `pre_edit_check`, `scout_search`, `file_summarize`, `deps_map`, `impact_analyze`, `find_similar_issues`, `audit_batch`) are marked `readOnlyHint=true` and `idempotentHint=true`. Operation-enum tools that bundle reads and writes under one name (e.g. `memory`, `session_mine`, `scope`, `context`) are marked `readOnlyHint=false`. All tools are local (`openWorldHint=false`). MCP clients and Claude Code's permission system use these annotations to skip confirmation prompts on read-only calls.

### `session_mine` Tool

| Operation | Parameters | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `search` | `query`, `project_path`, `limit?`, `method?`, `since?`, `until?`, `kind?` | Semantic search across past conversations. `kind` filters by hit type: `decision`/`next-step`/`error`/`narration` — regex-classified, LLM-free. |
| `decisions` | `query`, `project_path` | Find when/why a decision was made, with context |
| `replay` | `file_path`, `project_path`, `limit?` | Find discussions about a specific file |
| `struggles` | `project_path` | Files/areas with repeated difficulty |
| `errors` | `project_path` | Recurring error patterns across sessions |
| `correlations` | `project_path` | Files frequently edited together |
| `timeline` | `project_path` | Project development timeline |
| `summaries` | `project_path` | Auto-generated session summaries |
| `overview` | `project_path` | High-level project stats |
| `status` | `project_path` | Mining index coverage |
| `reindex` | `project_path`, `mode?` | Trigger background re-indexing (post_session, bootstrap, full) |
| `predict` | `file_path`, `project_path` | Predict context needed for a file edit |
| `cross_project` | — | Patterns across all projects |
| `reflect` | `project_path` | Injection precision report: which context kinds (memory/prediction/precheck/blast) precede passing tests, plus LLM-synthesized insights from recurring mistakes/patterns |
| `commitments` | `project_path` | Reads the LIVE transcript (newest *.jsonl, picked by newest last-message timestamp) for open-loop items. Two channels: DEFERRED scans ~450 recent messages for next-session/remaining/TODO/follow-up/defer mentions; IN-FLIGHT scans last ~30 messages for "I'll"/"let me"/"next" actions. Heuristic, LLM-free. The post-session mining index cannot see the open session; this op fills that gap. Run before asking "what next?" or on session resume. |

## Changelog

### v0.8.0 — 2026-06-10

- **Tool surface trimmed (19 → 16).** Removed `loop` (loop detection is hook-automatic and per-session now), `output` (its `validate_code`/`validate_result` checks are covered by `audit_batch`'s inline mode), and `scout_analyze` (zero recorded use). The remaining 16: `claude_engram_status`, `session_start`, `session_end`, `pre_edit_check`, `memory`, `work`, `scope`, `context`, `convention`, `scout_search`, `file_summarize`, `deps_map`, `impact_analyze`, `find_similar_issues`, `audit_batch`, `session_mine`.
- **LLM role narrowed — Ollama is now an optional flavor.** It is used only by `memory(consolidate)` and `session_mine(reflect)` insight synthesis (both background, both degrade silently without it), plus `scout_search` when available. Everything proactive — hooks, code index, precheck, blast-radius, injection scoring — is LLM-free.
- **`convention(check)` is now a deterministic pattern check** against stored conventions (the LLM mode was removed: its "no check-mark means violation" heuristic was a false-positive machine with zero recorded use).
- **`file_summarize` is structural only** — the `mode` parameter and the LLM "detailed" mode are gone. It returns purpose, exports, dependencies, and a complexity estimate from pattern/structure analysis.
- **`audit_batch` and `find_similar_issues` are pure regex/AST** — no LLM, no network (they never were; the docs are now explicit).
- **Loop-detection state is per-session.** Edit counts and test results live in the session's hook state (`sessions/<sid>.json`), not the shared `~/.claude_engram/loop_detector.json` — two concurrent sessions no longer cross-contaminate. The old `loop_detector.json` is abandoned (harmless if present).
- **Pre-edit no longer records file edits** (only post-edit does), so denied or failed edits aren't counted toward the loop threshold.
- **Session-mining merge + per-phase error isolation.** A session that grows after being indexed (PreCompact then SessionEnd) now MERGES counts instead of resetting them; each miner phase is error-isolated and `mining_status.json` records which phase failed (`phase_errors`).
- **Auto-logged mistakes/decisions in a brand-new project are no longer dropped** — the project is auto-registered in the manifest first.
- **New env var `CLAUDE_ENGRAM_DIR`** overrides the storage location (default `~/.claude_engram`) and is the supported test-isolation seam.
- **`memory(embed_all)` fixed** — it crashed with a `NameError` since the args rename; it now reads its `force` flag from the call args.
- **No emojis in any output.**

### v0.7.1 — 2026-06-02

- **Fix: `checkpoint_restore` / `checkpoint_list` could seat a stale checkpoint at index 0.** A sub-project query (e.g. `myproject/service-c`) walks up to ancestor rings; `read_latest` returned the *first* candidate ring's `latest_handoff.json` regardless of age, so a weeks-old handoff could occupy index 0 while the genuine latest sat lower — an autonomous resume trusting index 0 could act on the wrong plan. Restore now selects the newest **deliberate (manual)** checkpoint across the resolved scope: a newer manual outranks an older one (kills the stale win), and a routine auto session-stop never buries a deliberate checkpoint; it falls back to newest-of-any-kind only when no manual is in scope. `read_history` now folds each ring's `latest` pointer into the merged view (a legacy single-slot handoff is never missed), and `read_ordered` pins this corrected latest at index 0, so `checkpoint_restore index=0` == `checkpoint_list[0]` == `get_by_index(0)`. Read-path only — no migration; existing rings are re-interpreted correctly. New regression test: `tests/bench_restore_recency_scope.py`.

### v0.7.0 — 2026-06-01

- **`session_mine(commitments)`** — reads the LIVE session transcript (newest *.jsonl, picked by newest last-message timestamp) for open-loop items the post-session mining index cannot see. DEFERRED channel scans ~450 recent messages for next-session/remaining/TODO/follow-up/defer language; IN-FLIGHT channel scans last ~30 messages for "I'll"/"let me"/"next" actions. Heuristic, LLM-free.
- **Typed search (`session_mine(search, kind=...)`)** — every search hit is now classified by kind (`decision`/`next-step`/`error`/`narration`) using regex, no LLM. Pass `kind` to filter results to one type.
- **MCP tool annotations** — all 19 MCP tools carry `readOnlyHint`/`idempotentHint`/`title`/`openWorldHint` annotations. 10 read-only analysis tools are marked read-only + idempotent; write-capable tools are marked accordingly; all are local (`openWorldHint=false`). Allows MCP clients and Claude Code's permission system to skip prompts on read-only calls.
- **Consolidation hardening + re-date/down-rank migration** — memory consolidation is more conservative; a background migration re-dates and down-ranks over-promoted entries produced by prior aggressive runs.
- **Memory age at injection** — pre-edit hook output now shows each injected memory's age alongside its score, so Claude can weight stale memories appropriately.
- **Per-project HANDOFF.md + `checkpoint_list` scoping** — `checkpoint_save` writes HANDOFF.md to the project directory (not only global checkpoints/); `checkpoint_list` is scoped to the active project and hides entries older than 7 days by default.

### v0.5.0 — 2026-05-28

- **Durable session handoffs** — replaces the single overwritable `latest_handoff.json` slot with a capped ring buffer (`handoff_history.json`, last 20)
  - Promotion guard: a trivial auto-handoff (no files edited, no decisions) never overwrites a substantive or manual handoff; manual handoffs always win
  - `kind: manual|auto` marker on every handoff
  - Walk-up read resolution: nearest project first, ancestors next, global slot last — a sub-project's handoff is no longer shadowed by the shared global slot
  - New `handoff_list` operation + `index` parameter on `handoff_get` to list and retrieve older handoffs (index 0 = latest, then newest-first)
  - The three handoff writers (`create_handoff`, Stop hook, PreCompact hook) now share one `handoff_store` module
  - Backward compatible: `latest_handoff.json` is kept in sync; an existing slot is seeded into history on first write (old/downgraded clients keep working)
- **Path-aware mistake relevance** — a shared basename across diverging paths (e.g. `service-a/.../__init__.py` vs `service-b/.../__init__.py`) is no longer treated as a match; generic basenames (`__init__.py`, `index.js`, …) require a full-path signal. Stops cross-version/cross-project mistakes firing on unrelated edits while preserving real matches
- **Actionable recurring errors** — pattern detection groups by a normalized signature (exception class + message with names/paths/numbers templated) instead of the bare exception class. `patterns.json` refreshes on the next mining pass
- **Fixes** — empty `<engram-error></engram-error>` tag suppressed; `last_message_preview` dropped from handoffs; `handoff_get` no longer prints the summary twice; `checkpoint_list` hides checkpoints older than 7 days (opt-in prune)
- **`extract_file_refs` fix** — it used a *capturing* group, so `re.findall` returned only the extension and silently dropped every path, storing basenames only. This was the root data cause of cross-version false positives (`related_files` never carried directory context). Now captures full/relative paths
- **Automatic, idempotent migrations** — on upgrade a version-stamped migration (run from the SessionStart hook and `install.py`, tracked in `manifest.migrations_applied`) seeds handoff history from the old single-slot file and, off the hook hot path, re-extracts `related_files` to full paths for existing memories. Forward-only, safe to re-run, downgrade-safe, no re-mine
- **Versioning** — `pyproject` version corrected (had lagged at 0.2.0 through the 0.3.x–0.4.x feature work)
- New benchmarks: `bench_handoff_durability.py`, `bench_path_relevance.py`

### v0.4.0 — 2026-04-08

- **Session mining platform** — automatically mines Claude Code session JSONL logs for intelligence
  - JSONL parser with streaming reader, path resolution, content extractors
  - Incremental session index with byte-offset cursors (8ms read, 1.5s full build for 330MB)
  - Background miner subprocess (fire-and-forget from SessionEnd hook)
  - Structural + semantic extractors: decisions, mistakes, approaches, user corrections
  - Cross-session semantic search: 7310 chunks indexed, 112ms query time
  - Pattern detection: struggle files, recurring errors, edit correlations
  - Project timeline, auto session summaries, project overview
  - Predictive context: related files + likely errors auto-injected before edits
  - Cross-project learning: aggregate patterns across all projects
  - Retroactive bootstrap: auto-mines existing session history on first use
- **Batch embedding protocol** — `embed_batch` in scorer server, 22x faster than individual calls
- **`session_mine` MCP tool** — 13 operations (search, decisions, replay, predict, cross_project, etc.)
- **`/engram` skill** — slash command installed to `~/.claude/commands/`
- **Smart session start** — shows last session context + recurring patterns
- **Obsidian vault compatibility** verified (25/25 benchmark with PARA + CLAUDE.md structure)
